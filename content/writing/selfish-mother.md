Last week, I was asked what I would like to do on my perfect mother's day. If I could do anything, have anything, be with anyone - what would that day look like? 

I didn't say I wanted flowers or a card. I didn't ask for breakfast in bed or to sleep in. I wasn't noble enough to request a day spent with my loving family. Although, I would gladly accept any of it with a grateful heart.

My answer was quite simple: I would like to sit alone in a quiet, dark and empty room in complete silence. For the entire day. Nothing to do and nothing to say. No obligations. Nothing but myself.  

I would like the impossible. Impossible even in a time when isolation is so readily available. 

I found it telling, the thoughts that came flooding into my mind and the sensations I experienced in my body, when those very words came hurling out of my mouth. My palms began to sweat. My shoulders tensed. Immediate guilt. Instantly surveying my surroundings for the next thing to check off my revolving to-do list. For the next thing to add. I am ashamed of feeling that way. Humiliated for craving a few, long moments of loneliness. For silence. For solitude. 

I feel so selfish for wanting that. Yeah, I do. For so many reasons. I feel selfish for wanting a day to myself. Selfish for wanting to celebrate my motherhood with the antithesis of mothering - by doing absolutely nothing for anyone. Selfish for wanting to put down my overflowing, seemingly untouched plate. Wrap those leftovers in tinfoil and set it in the fridge for tomorrow. That's what I want though. I want a break. I want to not hear my name called a thousand times an hour. I want to leave the dishes in the sink and the laundry soaking in the tub. I want to leave the toys scattered across the living room floor. That single little plastic building block stranded under the fridge. I want to let the dust settle on my textbooks. Leave the cursor blinking on my unfinished essay. Let my laptop battery run out. I'd like to not have to cook a breakfast that I never eat. Or pour a tea that will sit steeping for hours until its lukewarm and bitter. It's the simple things. It doesn't feel so simple though. 

Why does it hurt so much to be called selfish? Why does it feel so wrong to want anything for myself? Why do I feel like asking for a little bit of space is asking for too much? The answers are not coming easily. Nonetheless, the answers are coming.

Selfishness. A word that stabs me so deep. A name I've been called for loving the wrong way. For caring too much. For daring to want something different than what others want for me. I hear the word and I cringe at its meaning. A word whose intention is to divulge one's lack of consideration, one's self-interests.
