There is this funky little disharmony in my thoughts that has become more pronounced in the past few years. Since I became a mother, really. I often find myself caught between the desire to keep my child little and the yearning to see into his future. My concept of time has shifted dramatically. Some days, I will it to slow down. I look at Silas and I don't recognize him for a split second. His limbs look longer, his imagination growing, his movements more confident. I have these days where I watch him interact with his environment and I'm blown away at how quickly he learns and how much he's absorbed in his young life.
